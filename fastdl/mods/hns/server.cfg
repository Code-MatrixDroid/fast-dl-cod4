set scr_hns_stealprotect 0 // It will try to prevent players from stealing files from your server (use Ninja's serverfile if you want 100% security!). Only turn it to 1, if you can't rename your config file to something random (like BKLfs58YIYPQmQN8900.cfg, if they don't know the name of the config file, they can't download it), or if your server has its own HNS private plugin which you don't want to share! It may be bad for the performance with many players (not that much probably, but it may matter), so keep it 0 if you don't have to use it.

Separate the code with dots ("."). The default stat is more than a billion, so you can calculate with bigger numbers (but don't exceed the limit of 2147483647, so for example don't multiply the number, except if you know, that it will stay smaller than this). Number IDs are starting from 0. "a666" - Add 666, "s666" - Subtract 666, "m2" - Multiply by 2, "r03" - Replace 0th and 3rd numbers, "o7612543098" - Order the numbers from 0123456789 to 7612543098. If you have no patience to test a cool code for yourself, then just rewrite some numbers in the example (which you are sure about). A code for example: s1000000002.o178420356.a116990.r17.m2
